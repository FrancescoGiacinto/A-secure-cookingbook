user_manager = Blueprint('user_manager', __name__)

# Sample route for user registration
@user_manager.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def register():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Handle user registration logic here (e.g. saving user data to database)
        # For simplicity, this is just a placeholder.
        username = request.form.get('username')
        password = request.form.get('password')
        # After registration, redirect the user to login page or dashboard.
        # This is just a placeholder, and the actual logic will be more comprehensive.
        return redirect(url_for('user_manager.login'))
    return render_template('register.html')  # You would need to create this template

# Sample route for user login
@user_manager.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Handle login logic here (e.g. checking credentials against the database)
        # For simplicity, this is just a placeholder.
        username = request.form.get('username')
        password = request.form.get('password')
        # If credentials are valid, log the user in and redirect them to their dashboard.
        # This is just a placeholder, and the actual logic will be more comprehensive.
        return redirect(url_for('views.index'))
    return render_template('login.html')  # You would need to create this template

# Later, you can add more routes/functions related to recipe management, password reset, user profile, etc.
